    "Tokens can be thought of as pieces of words. Before the API processes the prompts, the input is broken down into tokens. These tokens are not cut up exactly where the words start or end - tokens can include trailing spaces and even sub-words. Here are some helpful rules of thumb for understanding tokens in terms of lengths:\n",
    "- 1 token ~= 4 chars in English\n",
    "- 1 token ~= ¾ words\n",
    "- 100 tokens ~= 75 words\n",
    "\n",
    "How words are split into tokens is language-dependent.\n",
    "Depending on the model used, requests can use up to 4097 tokens shared between prompt and completion. If your prompt is 4000 tokens, your completion can be 97 tokens at most.\n",
    "The limit is currently a technical limitation, but there are often creative ways to solve problems within the limit, e.g. condensing your prompt, breaking the text into smaller pieces, etc."
